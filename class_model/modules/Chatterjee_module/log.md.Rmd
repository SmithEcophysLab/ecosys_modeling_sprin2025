# This is a log file to manually enter weekly updates to the mycorrhizal fungi module

## 03/04/2025

## what is the current state of your module? - I am still getting familiar with the literature. So I have no made any changes to the previous function that we did in our last homework.

## where are you at in the Kyker-Snowman road map?- I am on the "beginning to work with simple models" part.


## what papers have you been reading to refine your module?- Braghiere et al., 2021 ; Brzostek et al., 2014 

## what are your goals for the upcoming week? - narrow down important mathematical equations by reading more literature and compiling them into a document


## where do you need help from nick? -no help needed right now



## 03/25/2025

## what is the current state of your module? - I made a lot of changes and figured out the equations for my module. I added random numbers for the function to run.

## where are you at in the Kyker-Snowman road map?- I am on the "beginning to work with simple models" part.


## what papers have you been reading to refine your module?- Braghiere et al., 2021 ; Brzostek et al., 2014 ; Fischer et al., 2010

## what are your goals for the upcoming week? - I would write a function for each element such as Nsoil, Cplant, Nplant etc.


## where do you need help from nick? - I need help understanding partitioning of how much carbon and nitrogen needs to be put as inputs in my function. 

## 04/01/2025

## what is the current state of your module? - I added random number sequence to certain elements in the equation to see if the function is working.

## where are you at in the Kyker-Snowman road map?- I am on the "Quantifying and driving simple model at increasing scale" part. Even though we are not incorporating data, we are making observations with random numbers.


## what papers have you been reading to refine your module?- Braghiere et al., 2021 ; Brzostek et al., 2014 ; Fischer et al., 2010 

## what are your goals for the upcoming week? - Refining my module more and see if I need to add anything else.


## where do you need help from nick? - I need help understanding if my module looks good and if I need to add anything else to it.

## 04/08/2025

## what is the current state of your module? - I added sequences to 2 inputs in the equation and made ggplots to see if it supports my equation.

## where are you at in the Kyker-Snowman road map?- I am on the "Quantifying and driving simple model at increasing scale" part. 

## what papers have you been reading to refine your module?- Braghiere et al., 2021 ; Brzostek et al., 2014 ; Fischer et al., 2010 

## what are your goals for the upcoming week? - I will try to incorporate "npp" from class model because my module has npp too.

## where do you need help from nick? - I need help incorporating npp from class module into my module.
