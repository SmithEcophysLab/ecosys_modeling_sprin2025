## 02_28_2025

1. what is the current state of your module?
My module is the early stage of development, which focused on simulate/understand competition among plant functional groups for light, water and nutrients, and how this biotic interaction affect carbon allocation. I have implemented a function that calculates light intensity at the bottom of the canopy, adding arbitrary values that could reflect real data to test the function.  

2. where are you at in the Kyker-Snowman road map?
Currently, I am at the very early stage in which I am looking references for processes relevance and representativity, but also implementing equations simultaneously to readings.

i) Assess process and potential impact: 
- light competition
  - Does the process behave consistently through space and time?
	Yes, 
  - Is the process included in a ESM already?
	Yes, it has been incorporated: LPJ-DGVM, ED2, CLM.
  - Is the process likely to impact climate on ESM-relevant space and time scales?
	Yes, as light impacts photosynthesis, then plants will impact on the carbon balance and albedo regarding the canopy. 

- nutrient competition (coming)
  - Does the process behave consistently through space and time?
  - Is the process included in a ESM already?
  - Is the process likely to impact climate on ESM-relevant space and time scales?

- water competition (coming)
  - Does the process behave consistently through space and time?
  - Is the process included in a ESM already?
  - Is the process likely to impact climate on ESM-relevant space and time scales?

ii) Test process alone 
- light competition
  - Build simple model and explore if it explains observed patterns.
	I have built a simple function to predict arbitrary values of light reaching the bottom of the canopy based on available light from the sun and the one shaded from plants. I do not know yet if it fits observed patterns.
  - Gather data to quantify and drive simple model at increasing scales.

  - Scale modeled process globally and evaluate its performance across multiple regions.
  - Compare new existing approaches; assess changes in global simulation.

4. what are your goals for the upcoming week?
   -Find equations to implement for nutrient competition.
   -Keep identifying key papers for light competition and look for nutrient competition mechanisms papers. 


5. where do you need help from nick?
   -Addressing me to key literature based on my gaps.
