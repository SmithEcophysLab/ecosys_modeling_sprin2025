This is the log file where i enter the weekly updates to my module

## March 4 2025

current state of the module:

I identified the key processes and fluxes to be incorporated in my module and created a rough framework for the module. I updated the function with a few new inputs and outputs. At this point i still have fixed values for the potential parameters. I will update them each week.


Papers I read:

Wang, G., Post, W.M. and Mayes, M.A. (2013), Development of microbial-enzyme-mediated decomposition model parameters through steady-state and dynamic analyses. Ecological Applications, 23: 255-272. https://doi.org/10.1890/12-0681.1

goals for the upcoming week:

I will start looking for the specific equations and parameters values needed for the module. Hopefully, by the end of the next i will be able to refine the function with more details.


## March 24, 2025

current state of the module:

Over the spring break, I read a couple of papers to understand the basic processes that affect the carbon fraction in soil. I  tried to modify my current module a bit incorporating the feedback from Dr. Smith. I still have fixed values for the parameters. I am reviewing more literature looking for the equations to define the paramaeters values.

goals for the upcoming week:

I will continue looking for the specific equations and parameters values needed for the module. I will create a new function to estimate the each parameters values according to environmental factors.

Help from Dr. Smith
i will probably need help from Dr. Smith to pick/modify the equations as per my need.


## April 1, 2025

current state of the module:

I am still reviewing literature to understand the influence of the environmental drivers on soil carbon pools. I have created a simple model with fixed values for the parameters. Now, i have started modifying the model by incorporating the ecosystem processes and environmental drivers' effect. 

Papers I read:

Wieder, W. R., Grandy, A. S., Kallenbach, C. M., Taylor, P. G., & Bonan, G. B. (2015). Representing life in the Earth system with soil microbial functional traits in the MIMICS model. Geoscientific Model Development, 8(6), 1789-1808.

goals for the upcoming week:

I will continue looking for the specific equations and parameters values needed for the module. I will create a few more wrapper functions to represent major soil processes in the model.

Help from Dr. Smith
i will probably need help from Dr. Smith to pick/modify the equations as per my need.
