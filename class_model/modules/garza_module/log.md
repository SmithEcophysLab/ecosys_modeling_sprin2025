    # Test process alone
    # Jen Johnson Paper
    # Run my own test script
    # this model uses co2 and o2 in terms of pressure and I need to convert to ppm for use of the model

    #model works..? I think 
    # get some unexpected results, or maybe I just need to understand the model better

    # deciding statsic or dynamic 
    # it depends on absorbance cross sections, I think I will just use static
    # model definitely works, interesitngly enough there is no temperature response!
    # also looked into cytb6f density coefficients, will leave standard for now....
    # next, I need to add P model Stuff!
