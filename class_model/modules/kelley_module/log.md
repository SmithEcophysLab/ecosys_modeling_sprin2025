Weekly log file for tracking updates to kelley_module

## 2025/03/25
1. what is the current state of your module? Kyker-Snowman road map?
    - Assess process, looking at exisitng models + improving understanding of the process mechanisms

2. what papers have you been reading to refine your module?
    - Mollier, A., de Willigen, P., Heinen, M., Morel, C., Schneider, A., & Pellerin, S. (2008). A two-dimensional simulation model of phosphorus uptake including crop growth and P-response. Ecological Modelling, 210(4), 453–464. 
    - Wang, Y. P., Law, R. M., & Pak, B. (2010). A global model of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycles for the terrestrial biosphere. Biogeosciences, 7(7), 2261–2282. https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-7-2261-2010 

3. what are your goals for the upcoming week?
    - Improve the formulas going in, mainly just trying to understand what I is "ideal" to incorporate into my modual and how feasable that is for my level of skill.

4. where do you need help from nick?
    - When is the best time to separate out functions/ calculations from your module. 
    - Any tips on how to include time/ date-ranges? Is it a good idea to include specific dates since we want models to be more general than specific.

* Goals for upcoming week. 
1) Reading and reviewing CENTURY model/ others to refine phosphorus goal for module. 
2) Looking into mathmatical formulas baked into CENTURY model for potential additon into kelley_module

* Help from Nick? 
Currently okay, likely will have questions after this week/ weekend.
