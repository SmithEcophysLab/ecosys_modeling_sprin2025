This is a log file for manually entering weekly updates to the module.

## 2025-04-08

- Updated the model and performed sensitivity analysis
- This model is most sensitive to initial carbon stock, meaning at higher intial crabon stock/biomass the effect of moisture loss rate and vpd is more prominent (see Figure 1 and Figure 2)


### What is the current state of your module?  
Updated the model, now the model is very simple

#### Where are you at in the Kyker-Snowman road map?  
I am at identifying and understanding the process.  

### What papers have you been reading to refine your module?  
- Pausas (2022) Pyrogeography across the western Palaearctic: A diversity of fire regimes.
- Akihiko (2005) Modelling of carbon cycle and fire regime in an east Siberian larch forest.
- Incorporating recent findings from our lab works into the model and Wyse et al. (2018) works
 

### What are your goals for the upcoming week?  
- To determine whether the fire occcurence is deterministic or stocastic in the model.


### Where do you need help from Nick?  
- To set up the growth rate and how to incorporate it with the carbon stock over years
