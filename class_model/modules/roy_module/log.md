#This is a log file for my weekly update on the model

## 03.02.2025
what is the current state of your module? where are you at in the Kyker-Snowman road map?
-Test process alone part, specifically on building simple model

what papers have you been reading to refine your module?
1. Drought effects on litter fraction and recovery in a subtropical forest
2. Contrasting impacts of continuous moderate drought and episodic severe droughts on the aboveground-biomass increment and litterfall of three coexisting Mediterranean woody species

what are your goals for the upcoming week?
- to build a complete equation to measure litter biomass 

where do you need help from nick?
- defining parameters for the model

1. Climate drivers of litterfall biomass dynamics in three types of forest stands on the Loess Plateau

where do you need help from nick?
- Need suggestions if the parameters that I set make sense or not

## 04. 01. 2025
I did not change anything from the last update, just read one new paper
what papers have you been reading to refine your module?
1. Adaptive significance of evergreen vs. deciduous leaves: solving the triple paradox

I changed two parameters of my model, v=average temperature and precipitation. I used at least 200 inputs. For both case my
model is showing that litter biomass increase with average temperature and precipitation. Within the roy_module folder I saved two
figures of the graph that obtained from the test. Both are showing straight line. 
I want to discuss with Dr. Smith if the way I am running my model is correct or not, I have some constant and adjuster in my model, I
am not sure if I should keep them or use them like the way I used it for the sensitivity analysis.
