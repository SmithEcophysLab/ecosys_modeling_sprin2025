# Homework 6
From here on out, homeworks will follow a similar structure. They are designed to keep you
on task with developing your module and integrating it with the class model.

1. In your individual module folder, create a markdown file called "log.md"

2. In your log.md file, create a header (single #) and insert the text "log.md" to indicate
that this is the title of your document

3. Underneath your header add text explaining what this file is. Specifically, note that this
is a log file for you to manually enter your weekly updates to your module.

4. Create a sub-header (double ##) with today's date

5. Underneath the subheader, add the following questions and answers:
	- what is the current state of your module?
		- where are you at in the Kyker-Snowman road map?
	- what papers have you been reading to refine your module?
	- what are your goals for the upcoming week?
	- where do you need help from nick? 

6. Push your changes to your branch and create a pull request to pull your branch into the main
branch on GitHub.

The assignment is due by the start of next class period.
