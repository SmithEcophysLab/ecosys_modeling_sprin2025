# Class notes for March 25, 2025
**Guest appearance from Josh Fisher (Chapman U.)**

## Objectives
- Discuss simulations of GPP

## Agenda
1. Guest lecture from Josh Fisher
	- terrestrial ecosystem models
	- FUN model
2. Time for Q&A

## Homework
- Continue reading up on the processes for your module
- Work on module development

## In-class notes
### notes from meeting with josh fisher
- professor at chapman, works at space company as well
- postdoc in UK on climate modeling and experiments
- phd with dennis baldocchi at uc berkeley
- PFTs: who's to determine what is important
	- moving to trait-based implementations
- nutrient cycles are a relatively recent phenomenon
- models will be inherently flawed, always
- many of the model uncertainties are the ones the class is working on
- a lot of things "you gotta put in" while knowing you will probably get it wrong
- our models represent ecosystems like a cartoon, but it's more complex than that
- global change throws everything off...
	- this is why we have uncertainty in models
- model development done by blind men, but only in certain places around the world
- two poles of the C carbon cycle: arctic and tropics
	- not where we are taking data!
- hard for modelers to take data and improve models
- golden age of remote sensing -- but how do we include it
- academic fight about what is happening with drought in amazon
	- green-up but also trees dying?
- droughts are happening so fast that the amazon cannot recover
- nutrients are a key knob on the siphoning off of atmospheric co2 from the atmosphere by plants
- fun is an economic model with carbon as the currency
	- developed from scratch based on understanding of different exchanges
- created best possible model with physical realism
	- allowed it to grow from the original base structure
- remote sensing techniques to help constrain the model
- land is biggest model uncertainty
	- within that, the co2 effect is the largest uncertainty
- volcanoes and natural co2 sources can be used to estimate co2 fertilization effect
- addressing global food security with soil moisture monitoring
	- can predict droughts ahead of time
	- ecostress measures surface temperature to optimize agriculture
- class using ecostress data (all online)
- no way to measure soil carbon at depth at large scale (e.g., via remote sensing)
- can use ecostress to see fires
	- can see forest stress to predict fire dynamics
	- can communicate to fire managers on the ground
	- can calculate ET (less ET = more stress)
- fun model k functions
	- designed to shape the curve however you want
	- these are uncertain
- what scale are these models designed for
	- designed for individuals but are applied to communities
- fun-photosynthesis coupling
	- separate sort of things
