# Quiz 6

1. How does EEO theory "harness the power of natural selection"?

2. Describe a tradeoff associated with an ecological process or trait relevant for land
surface models that has or could form the basis of EEO model-based development.

3. Data can always be used to fit modeled parameters. However, if modeled processes represent
hypotheses, what might a model-data comparison tell you beyond the potential value to
use for a parameter?

4. Why are experiments particularly useful for testing modeled processes? What can
they tell you that observational data cannot?

We will work on this quiz at the beginning of class (~15 minutes).
