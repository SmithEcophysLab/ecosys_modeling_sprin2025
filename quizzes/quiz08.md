1. Why is there a deficiency of large-scale models that can track carbon allocation?

2. Explain Coordination theory with an example

3. What are the limitations of using fixed allocation approach and reaction norm to model carbon allocation?

4. When choosing an eco-evolutionarily based model for carbon allocation, would you 
prefer to use an optimal response or game-theoretic optimization? State you reasons for 
choosing the one over the other.

We will work on this quiz at the beginning of class (~15 minutes).
