# Quiz 9

1. How has including the nitrogen (N) cycle interactions into second generation Dynamic Global 
Vegetation Models (DGVMâ€™s) affected the uncertainty in carbon (C) cycle projections?

2. What environmental factors directly influence C:N stoichiometry and photosynthesis, and why?

3. What is the main finding regarding N fertilizations on leaf-level photosynthetic capacity?

4. Stocker et al. show a demonstration model that accurately predicts 
responses to N and CO2 fertilization. What hypotheses form the basis for this model? 

We will work on this quiz at the beginning of class (~15 minutes).
