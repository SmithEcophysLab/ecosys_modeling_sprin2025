# Readings
Below are the readings for Fall 2025 Physiological Plant Ecology.
These readings should be done before class. In each case, students must submit a short
summary of the reading as well as two questions that arose during the reading.
The rubric these assignments can be found in the [rubrics](../rubrics/feedback_rubric.md) folder.
