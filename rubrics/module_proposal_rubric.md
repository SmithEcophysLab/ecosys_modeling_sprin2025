# Module Proposal Rubric
The purpose of the module proposal is to lay out your idea for the module that will
constitute your class project as a way to receive feedback and, ultimately, improve your project.
This will involve a short, written idea for the review and a short presentation. The proposal will be
reviewed by Dr. Smith.
