# Grading rubric for final module and oral presentation
As mentioned in the syllabus,
the primary semester project will be to develop a module for a terrestrial ecosystem model.
The module should be able to simulate a terrestrial ecosystem process
or processes. The module code should be written in R and run in a stand-alone format.
The code should be accompanied by full descriptions of the module in both
README- and manuscript-style format. The manuscript-style writeup should include a description
of model sensitivity to parameters and input data as well as areas for improvement.
The module should contain both the code for the functions as well as code
to test the module. Students will be asked to give a ~10 minute presentation on the structure
and functioning of their module.

Both the module itself and oral presentation will be graded for the same elements.

## Grading Rubric (100 points total)
Grading will follow the rubric below.

### Module functionality (20 points)
Full points will be given if the module runs in stand-alone mode. This should be capable from
the test script without any errors. The module should also run at various levels of
input and parameter values. Bonus points may be given to offset any point reductions to
other sections if the module can run coupled to the class model.

### README description of module (20 points)
The README.md file will be awarded full points if there is a full description
of the module components, including units and citations. This should include descriptions
of the function files as well as any accompanying files in the module, such as
the test script.

### Manuscript-style description of module (20 points)
This should be a .pdf file that fully describes your module in a manner
similar to that seen in the Methods section of a manuscript. This should include
a full description of the module functions, parameters, and necessary input data.
All units should be clearly defined and citations where necessary. This should include
both in-text citations and a full bibliography.  

### Description of module sensitivity and areas for improvement (20 points)
The .pdf file describing the module should also include a section on the module
sensitivity and areas for future improvement. The module sensitivity should describe how the
output variables from the module respond to varying parameter levels and values for
input data. The future improvement section should include the next steps to fully
refining the module, couched within the framework of Kyker-Snowman et al. (2021).

### Oral presentation (20 points)
The oral presentation should introduce the module and demonstrate how it works,
but does not necessarily need to cover all details of the module.
